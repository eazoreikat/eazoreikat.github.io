### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it is what started me on my journey to learn about github and git commands. My partner Benjy was also great and I really enjoyed working with them during the lab time. It is also my first semester and first class at CSUF so it was a really memorable experience for me on this campus. 

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was another one of my favorite labs. Creating this game that involves 2 players was really interesting to create. My lab partner, Grace, and I had a very fun time solving the problems we ran into and we were able to finish with minimal help by using our notes and resources. Using multiple if statements to tell the user if they were above or under the secret number was also fun to code. 

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was a super interesting and difficult lab for my lab partner, Itzel, and I to complete. Figuring out how to write down functions to read through the table using for loops and figuring out how to read each column like 2 way table was interesting to figure out and solve. By doing this lab, we were able to get a better understanding about how to use vectors to make a 2D vector of strings and call it at different columns.
